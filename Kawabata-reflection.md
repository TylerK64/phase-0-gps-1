What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I wouldn't say there was anything specifically git related that I was struggling with before the GPS session, but overall I'd say I wasn't terribly comfortable with all the commands yet. Working with a guide definitely helped smooth out the edges to get me going. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Overall, I'd say how to establish a good workflow was something we talked about a lot and was particularly insightful. More specifically good git maintenance practices, nuances of commits and commit messages, and good branching practices were some of the things discussed during the session.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
One question in particular that I was curious about was the 'pull' command. I wanted to clarify that it was used both from local to Github and vice versa. John's advice on explaining the merge conflict case was very helpful as well. 

What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still unsure of some of the finer commands of git, like -b when creating a new branch or what 'origin' actually means. But that's also more of a general command line issue. Also when exactly is the 'best' point to merge a feature branch back into master is a bit vague still. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I actually did not have a partner for my first GPS session, only a guide. Despite that, everything ran fairly smoothly and worked out well. My guide was very helpful and gave me all the tools I needed to figure out the assignment.
